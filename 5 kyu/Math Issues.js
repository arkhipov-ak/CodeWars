// Oh no, our Math object was "accidently" reset. Can you re-implement some of those functions? We can assure, that only non-negative numbers are passed as arguments. So you don't have to consider things like undefined, null, NaN, negative numbers, strings and so on.

// Here is a list of functions, we need:

// Math.round()
// Math.ceil()
// Math.floor()

Math.round = function (number) {
	return +number.toFixed()
}

Math.ceil = function (number) {
	return parseInt(number) === number ? number : parseInt(number) + 1
}

Math.floor = function (number) {
	return parseInt(number)
}
