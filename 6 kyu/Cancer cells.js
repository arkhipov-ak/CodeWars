// Your task is to write a function which cuts cancer cells from the body.

// Cancer cells are divided into two types:
// Advance stage,described as letter C
// Initial stage,described as letter c
// Rest cells are divided as follows:

// Normal cell,described as lowercase letter
// Important cell,described as uppercase letter
// Prerequisites:
// Important cell,cannot be cut out.
// Advance cancer cell,should be cut out with adjacent cells if it can be done.
// Function input is a string (representing a body), remove "cancer" characters (based on the described rules) and return the body cured of those "cancer" characters.

function cutCancerCells(organism) {
	return organism.replace(/c|[a-z]?C[a-z]?/g, '')
}
